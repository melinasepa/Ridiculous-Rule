    <p>SAM WAS HERE</p>
    <h1>The Most Ridiculous Rule</h1>
    <h3>It began at St. Thomas the Apostle, my catholic grade school.</h3>
    <p>We had to walk in a huge circle, moving right, to get to the next class even if it was just across the hall!
      </p>
      <h4>Most Annoying Part...</h4>
      <p>I remember that my first class each morning was science, located directly across the hall from my homeroom. I always hated having to loop around the entire floor just to get to class.
